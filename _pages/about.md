I am a research associate with the College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT). I got my PhD at NUDT in 06/2019 and my bachelor's degree at NUDT in 06/2013. I was visiting the Advanced Analytics Institute, University of Technology Sydney (UTS) during 09/2016-09/2018. 

My research interests include machine learning, representation learning, outlier detection, network/graph representation,  mulitmodal learning and system software for AI. I have published more than 30 high-quality research papers in these areas, most of which were published at premier data science and AI conferences or journals, like AAAI, ICML, The ACM Web Conference, IJCAI, CIKM, IEEE TKDE and Computer & Security. I have generally served as a PC member at over 10 premier international conferences including AAAI, IJCAI and a reviewer for more than 10 prestigious journals including IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TNNLS, IPM etc.

I am always seeking highly self-motivated students for PhD, Master by Research.
