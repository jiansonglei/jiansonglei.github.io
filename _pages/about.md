I am an Associate Research Fellow with the College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT). I was visiting the Advanced Analytics Institute, University of Technology Sydney (UTS) during 09/2016-09/2018 and working with Professor Longbing Cao. I got my PhD at NUDT in 06/2019 and my bachelor's degree at NUDT in 06/2013.
